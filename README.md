# Rush

A portmanteau of rust shell

### What is Rush? 

In its early alpha stages, but rush is aiming to become an open-source, rust-based shell with full bash compatibility and full functionality.
This is more of a student-made project than a real thing, but who knows?

### What can it do?

Currently, not much. As of writing, it does not support execution of programs,
only supporting those built in. The only available command is cd.
